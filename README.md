🔭 A little bit about myself: ...

My name is Ahmed - aka **Tito** 🤚🏻. I am a Software Engineer 💻 , mainly Android 🤖 , with +8 years of experience. Currently, I am a Senior Software Engineer at Zendesk in Ireland 🇮🇪 since November 2019.

I worked before in well-known and fine startups in Egypt 🇪🇬 like [Swvl](https://www.swvl.com/), [Eventtus](https://eventtus.com/virtual), [DigitalYards](https://digitalyard.com/), and [StarWallet Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/starwallet-labs/).

Proudly, I am one of [EGDroid](https://www.facebook.com/egdroid) founders. A community that helps and mentors Android Engineers. We did four successful meetups so far, an online course for learning Android from scratch, and we have our slack channel to connect the android developer and share the up-to-date android stuff.

Also, I held [several talks](https://ahmedadeltito.com/tabs/talks/) in different places like [Instabug](https://instabug.com/), [Tafra](https://www.facebook.com/tafraio/), [EGDroid](https://www.facebook.com/egdroid/), [Trella](https://www.trella.app/), [Freelance Yard](https://www.facebook.com/freelanceyard/), and [Techila Con](https://techilacon.com/) where more than +500 techies attended. You can check most of them from [here](http://ahmedadeltito.com/tabs/talks/).

As a part of the Android Community, I did some open-source android projects and libraries like [PhotoEditor SDK](https://ahmedadeltito.com/projects/photo-editor-sdk/), [Gradient Polyline project](https://ahmedadeltito.com/projects/gradient-polyline/), [Social Media Sign Up library](https://ahmedadeltito.com/projects/social-media-sign-up/), and more.

Besides, I mentored tens of techies and helped them improve their android level to reach seniority. As a result, I create an [Android Developer Roadmap](https://ahmedadeltito.com/tabs/mentor/) to help anyone learn Android from scratch. It helped a lot of people, and we use it in Zendesk for the interns.
